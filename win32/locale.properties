# locale.properties defines the localised text for the user interface
# Some definitions are commented out because they duplicate another string
# The format of each line is original=localised, such as File=&Fichier
# Even though the original text may have ellipses "..." and access key
# indicators "&" in the user interface, these do not appear in this file
# for the original texts. Translated texts should have an access key indicator
# if needed as the translated text may not include the original access key.
# Ellipses are automatically added when needed.
# Each original text may have only one translation, even if it appears in
# different parts of the user interface.
