<h3>Lua Scripting Extension Notes</h3>
<pre>
<tt>
The SciTE Lua Scripting Extension uses a verbatim copy of Lua 5.0.2 as
its scripting engine.  Currently, all of the standard libraries are
included, although this list may be trimmed in a future revision.

Lua is Copyright (C) 2003 TeCGraf, PUC-Rio.  The complete Lua license
is included in license.txt in the SciTE installation directory.  To
find more information about Lua, including documentation for the
language itself, visit <a href="http://www.lua.org">www.lua.org</a>.

<b>SciTE Properties and Lua Event / Command Handlers</b>

The properties ext.lua.startup.script and extension.<i>filepattern</i>
can be used to define commands and event handlers that will be called
by the SciTE.  Other properties beginning with ext.lua may also
influence how Lua behaves.  See the <a href="SciTEDoc.html">SciTE Documentation</a>
for more details on this.

By defining functions in the startup script or the active extension
script, you can tailor SciTE to your needs, adding new behavior and
functionality that is tightly integrated.

To begin, you can handle any many of the events exposed by the
<a href="SciTEExtension.html">SciTE Extension Interface</a>.  You do
this simply by defining functions with the same name as the event.
Currently, OnOpen, OnSwitchFile, OnSave, OnBeforeSave, OnChar,
OnSavePointReached, OnSavePointLeft, OnDoubleClick, and OnMarginClick
are supported.

For some of these events, SciTE will pass one or more arguments to
the event handler function: OnOpen, OnSwitchFile, OnSave, and
OnBeforeSave will receive the filename of the affected buffer as
their first argument.  OnChar can expect a single-character string
argument. The other event handlers will not be passed any arguments.

In addition to event handlers, you can also use define new commands
that are available through the Tools menu or through keyboard shortcuts.
To specify that a command that will be handled by Lua, specify
subsystem 3 for the command.  Then, to implement the command using Lua,
just define a global function.  The command name is the function name.

You can also use predefined functions like dofile and dostring as tool
commands.

Anything specified after the command name is passed to the Lua function
as a single string argument.  An example of a command, using the
built-in dofile command, is shown below.

  command.name.1.*=Run My Script
  command.subsystem.1.*=3
  command.1.*=dofile $(SciteDefaultHome)/My Script.lua

Note that the command line is &quot;not&quot; evaluated directly
as a Lua script.

If there is no function matching the command name, no error will be
displayed.  This is because Lua assumes in this case that the command
is meant for some other extension, such as the <a href="SciTEDirector.html">SciTE Director
Extension</a>.  However, if the command function is found, but fails
to execute, an error is reported.

<b>Predefined Lua Functions and Objects:</b>

Within Lua scripts you can use the following functions / objects:

  alert(s) - writes s to the output pane with &quot;&gt;&quot; prefix
  trace(s) - writes s to the output pane (no prefix, no newlines)
  dostring(s) - executes s as a Lua string, like Lua 4&#39;s dostring
  editor - the editor pane
  output - the output pane
  props - a pseudo-table representing the SciTE properties

In addition, all constants defined in Scintilla.iface are exposed as Lua
globals.  Function names are exposed as their block capital equivalents,
with the SCI_ prefix.

All functions and objects defined in the Lua standard library are also
available.  Although dostring was deprecated in Lua 5, it is restored
since some have said it would be useful in tool commands.

A function _ALERT() is also defined to be an alias for alert().  This
provides a reasonable way for Lua to present error messages to the
user.  You are free to override _ALERT with a different definition if
you prefer.

The props pseudo-table allows you to read or write properties by name
using normal Lua table-access semantics, e.g. props["property.name"].

The editor and output panes support the following properties / methods:

  textrange(startPos, endPos) - gets the text in the specified range
  findtext(text, [flags], [startPos, [endPos]])
    - returns the start and end of the first match, or -1 if no match

  insert(pos, text) - inserts text at the specified position *
  remove(startPos, endPos) - removes the text in the range *

Most of the functions defined in Scintilla.iface are also be exposed as
pane methods.  Those functions having simple parameters (strings and
numeric types) are fully supported, e.g. editor:SetTabWidth(8).  Functions
having a stringresult parameter will include a string in the return value.
For both strings and stringresults, if the function is documented as
expecting a length as its first parameter, you do not pass the length
from Lua.  Instead, it is inferred from the context.

Functions that have more complex parameters are not supported.  The keymod
parameter type has partial support.  For a keymod parameter, you  would
pass a string in the same notation used in SciTEGlobal.properties for key
sequences, e.g. &quot;Ctrl+Shift+F5&quot;.

Functions that are declared to return a numeric type have the result
added to their return value.  If the function also has a stringresult,
that comes first, followed by the numeric return value.

* Since insert is practically the same as the iface function InsertText,
and remove can easily be done as a SetSel followed by Clear, these two
methods may have a very short life.  The textrange and findtext methods,
on the other hand, will be around for a while since they do not have
simple exquivalents.

<b>Disabling Lua</b>

Lua is currently loaded just-in-time, before it is first used.  Thus, if
you do not use Lua, it will not be enabled.  The ways that Lua can be
enabled are through the ext.lua.startup.script property, by naming a
lua file named in the extension.<i>filepattern</i> property, or by using
the extension  mechanism to define tool commands (i.e. subsystem 3).  If
you do not do any of these things, the Lua scripting engine is not
loaded, and for all practical purposes, SciTE should behave as it did
before Lua was added.

Nevertheless, it is still possible to build SciTE without the Lua support.
To do this, simply define the variable NO_LUA when you build it, e.g. for
MSVC, nmake -f scite.mak -DNO_LUA; or with GNU tools, make NO_LUA=1.
