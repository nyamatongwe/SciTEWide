    <h2>
       Download.
    </h2>
    <p>
       The <a href="License.txt">license</a> for using Scintilla or SciTE is similar to that of Python
      containing very few restrictions.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Release 1.30
    </h3>
    <h4>
       Source Code
    </h4>
       The source code package contains all of the source code for Scintilla and SciTE but no binary 
	executable code and is available in 
       <ul>
       <li><a href="scite130.zip">zip format</a> (440K) commonly used on Windows</li>
       <li><a href="scite130.tgz">tgz format</a> (400K) commonly used on Linux and compatible operating systems</li>
       </ul>
       Instructions for building on both Windows and Linux are included in the readme file.
    <h4>
       Windows Executables
    </h4>
    <p>
       A <a href="wscite130.zip">full download</a> (230K) includes the SciTE executable, any required DLLs, 
      configuration files and documentation. After downloading the file, unzip it, and run 
      SciTE.EXE. The files required to run SciTE are SciTE.EXE, SciLexer.DLL, and 
      SciTEGlobal.properties and these are best located in one directory on the path.
    </p>
    <p>
       A <a href="Sc1.exe">single file executable called Sc1</a> (130K) does not need any DLL or
      properties files as these are linked into the executable. You may still create properties
      files if you wish. 
      Sc1.exe has been compressed with the 
      <a href="http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html">UPX compressor</a> 
      so that it is a fast download. It does not need to be decompressed to be used.
    </p>
    <h4>
       Linux executable for Intel compatible processors
    </h4>
    <p>
      If this binary download does not work, you should download and compile the source package.
      As it uses GTK+ 1.2.x, a copy of GTK+ 1.2.x must be installed. Most recent distributions such 
      as Red Hat 6.0 will have this.
    </p>
    <p>
       A <a href="gscite130.tgz">full download</a> (250K) includes the SciTE executable, 
      configuration files and documentation. After downloading the file, gunzip and untar it, and run 
      SciTE. The files required to run SciTE are SciTE which is best located on the path 
      (I put it in /usr/local/bin) and ten properties files which must be located in the 
      /usr/local/share/scite directory.
    </p>
    <h4>
       Linux executable for Sparc
    </h4>
    <p>
       A <a href="scite.linux-sparc.bin.gz">version 1.25 compiled for Sparc</a> (170K).
