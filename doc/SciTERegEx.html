       Regular Expressions in SciTE
    </h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Regular expressions can be used for searching for patterns 
      rather than literals. For example, it is possible to 
      search for variables in SciTE property files, 
      which look like $(name) with the regular expression:<br />
      \$([a-z.]+)
    </p>
    <p>
      Replacement with regular expressions allows complex 
      transformations with the use of tagged expressions.
      For example, pairs of numbers separated by a ',' could
      be reordered by replacing the regular expression:<br />
      \([0-9]+\),\([0-9]+\)<br />
      with:<br />
      \2,\1
    </p>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
	<li>
	char    matches itself, unless it is a special character 
	(metachar): . \ [ ] * + ^ $
	</li><li>
	.       matches any character.
	</li><li>
     \       matches the character following it, except
	when followed by a left or right round bracket,
	a digit 1 to 9, one of the characters abfnrtv, 
	or a left or right angle bracket. 
	(see [7], [8] and [9])
	It is used as an escape character for all 
	other meta-characters, and itself. When used
	in a set ([4]), it is treated as an ordinary
	character.
	</li><li>
	[set]   matches one of the characters in the set.
	If the first character in the set is "^",
	it matches a character NOT in the set, i.e. 
	complements the set. A shorthand S-E is 
	used to specify a set of characters S up to 
	E, inclusive. The special characters "]" and 
	"-" have no special meaning if they appear 
	as the first chars in the set.
                examples:        match:

                        [a-z]    any lowercase alpha

                        [^]-]    any char except ] and -

                        [^A-Z]   any char except uppercase
                                 alpha

                        [a-zA-Z] any alpha
	</li><li>
	*       any regular expression form [1] to [4], followed by
	closure char (*) matches zero or more matches of
	that form.
	</li><li>
	+       same as [5], except it matches one or more.
	</li><li>
	a regular expression in the form [1] to [10], enclosed
	as \(form\) matches what form matches. The enclosure
	creates a set of tags, used for [8] and for
	pattern substitution. The tagged forms are numbered
	starting from 1.
	</li><li>
	a \ followed by a digit 1 to 9 matches whatever a
	previously tagged regular expression ([7]) matched.
	</li><li>
	a \ followed by one of the characters abftv is a control
	character. \a is BEL, \b is BS, \f is FF, \t is TAB, and \v is VT.
	</li><li>
	\&lt;	a regular expression starting with a \&lt; construct
	\&gt;	and/or ending with a \&gt; construct, restricts the
	pattern matching to the beginning of a word, and/or
	the end of a word. A word is defined to be a character
	string beginning and/or ending with the characters
	A-Z a-z 0-9 and _. It must also be preceded and/or
	followed by any character outside those mentioned.
	</li><li>
	a composite regular expression xy where x and y
	are in the form [1] to [10] matches the longest
	match of x followed by a match for y.
	</li><li>
^	a regular expression starting with a ^ character
$	and/or ending with a $ character, restricts the
                pattern matching to the beginning of the line,
                or the end of line. [anchors] Elsewhere in the
	pattern, ^ and $ are treated as ordinary characters.
	</li>
