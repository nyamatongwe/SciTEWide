    <h3>
       Standard Editing
    </h3>
    <p>
       Text editing in SciTE works similarly to most Macintosh or Windows editors with the added
      feature of automatic syntax styling. SciTE will only edit one file at a time, but does list
      recently opened files on the File menu making it easier to open recent files. Rectangular
      regions of text can be selected in SciTE by holding down the Alt key on Windows or the Ctrl
      key on GTK+ while dragging the mouse over the text.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are two panes in SciTE, the editing pane and the output pane. The output pane is
      located either to the left of the editing pane or below it. Initially it is of zero size, but
      it can be made larger by dragging the divider between it and the editing pane. The Edit |
      Vertical Split command can be used to move the output pane beneath the editing pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       SciTE can perform commands to compile or run source files with the output from these
      commands directed into the output pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, if <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is installed on the machine, open
      a new document, type:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<kbd>
print "Hi"
</kbd>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       as that document's text.
    </p>
    Save the document as printhi.py. <br />
     The document should now appear coloured as SciTE is using the file's extension to decide upon
    the syntax styling to use: 
    <blockquote>
	<code>
		<b><font color="#000080">print </font></b>
		<i><font color="#800080">"hi"</font></i>
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    Perform the Tools | Go command.<br />
     The output window will be made visible if it is not already visible and will show:<br />
    <blockquote>
	<code>
		<font color="#0000FF">&gt;python -u printhi.py</font><br />
		hi<br />
		<font color="#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 0</font>
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    The first blue line is from SciTE showing the command it will use to run the program. The black
    line is the output from running the Python program. The last blue line is from SciTE showing
    that the program has finished and displaying its exit code. An exit code of zero indicates a
    successful run. <br />
     
    <p>
       SciTE partially understands the error messages produced by Python, GCC, Visual C++, Borland
      C++ and other tools which use the same format as one of these. To see this, add a mistake to
      the Python file by adding a second line to make the file:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
	<code>
	<span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold;">print </span>
	<span style="color:#800080;font-style:italic;">"hi"</span><br />
	mistake
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       Perform the Tools | Go command. The results should look like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;python -u printhi.py</span>
hi
Traceback (innermost last):
  <span style="color:#FF0000">File "printhi.py", line 2, in ?</span>
    mistake
NameError: mistake
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 1</span>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       While it is easy to see where the problem is in this simple case, when a file is larger the
      Tools | Next Message command can be used to view each of the reported errors. Upon performing
      Tools | Next Message, the first error message in the output pane is highlighted with a yellow
      background, and an error indicator is displayed for the appropriate line in the editing pane.
      The caret is moved to this line and the pane is scrolled if needed to show the line. SciTE
      now looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="PrintHi.png" alt="SciTE after running Python interpreter" /> 
    <p>
       SciTE understands both the file name and line number parts of error messages in most cases
      so can open another file (such as a header file) if errors were caused by that file. This
      feature may not work where the file name is complicated by containing spaces or ".."
    </p>
    <p>
       If command execution has failed and is taking too long to complete then the Tools | Stop
      Executing command can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
       On Windows, SciTE defaults to executing tools as command line programs. Executing a GUI
      program in this mode results in that program being run without displaying a window. The
      command.subsystem option can be used to define tools that run in GUI mode. The default
      subsystem, 0, is for command line programs, 1 is for programs which create their own windows,
      and 2 is for using the ShellExecute call. ShellExecute is a good way to open HTML files and
      similar as it handles this similarly to a user opening the file from the shell.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Languages understood by SciTE
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE currently is able to syntax style these languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Python
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++
      </li>
      <li>
        Java
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML with embedded JavaScript
      </li>
      <li>
        XML
      </li>
      <li>
        INI, properties and similar
      </li>
      <li>
        VB and VBScript
      </li>
      <li>
        A subset of Perl
      </li>
      <li>
        SQL
      </li>
      <li>
        PHP (see later for setting up)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Running and building commands for some of these languages have been set up but should be
      checked as they will have to be modified to work for many people.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Keyboard commands
    </h3>
    <p>
       Keyboard commands in SciTE mostly follow common Windows and GTK+ conventions. Keyboard
      equivalents of menu commands are listed in the menus. Some less common commands with no menu
      equivalent are:

    <h3>
       Folding
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE supports folding for Python and C++/C/Java/Javascript. 
       Fold points are based upon indentation for Python and on counting braces 
       for the other languages.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Properties file
    </h3>
    <p>
       Much of SciTE's behaviour can be changed by editing the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are three properties files used, two global properties file found in the directory of the
      executable (for Linux, in the user's home directory) called "SciTEGlobal.properties" and 
      "SciTEUser.properties" and a
      local one which may be present in the same directory as the file being edited called
      "SciTE.properties". Settings in the local properties file override those in the global 
      properties files. The SciTEUser.properties file is intended for customisation by the user, 
      leaving the SciTEGlobal.properties file to contain the default options distributed with SciTE.
      The main use of the local properties files is to change the effects of the
      Compile, Build and Go commands for the files in a directory. For example, I use the javac
      compiler from the Java Development Kit for most work, so SciTEGlobal.properties sets the
      command for compiling .java files to "javac". If I want to use the jvc compiler for the files
      in one directory, then the SciTE.Properties file in that directory contains an entry setting
      the command to "jvc".
    </p>
    <p>
       A <a href="php.properties">properties file for PHP</a>  is available. To use it, copy its 
       contents into one of your properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are commands in the Tools menu for opening the global and local properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       The files are in approximately the same format as Java properties files which have a simple
      text format. Lines that start with '#' or that are completely blank are comments. Other lines
      are of the form
    </p>
    <p>
       variable=value
    </p>
    <p>
       For long values, a '\' character at the end of the line continues that value on the next
      line. Values may include the values of other variables by using $(variablename). There are
      some variables set by the environment to access the name of the current file as well:
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>FilePath</b> is the full path of the current file.<br />
       <b>FileDir</b> is the directory of the current file without a trailing slash.<br />
       <b>FileName</b> is the base name of the current file.<br />
       <b>FileExt</b> is the extension of the current file.<br />
       <b>FileNameExt</b> is $(FileName).$(FileExt).<br />
       <b>CurrentSelection</b> is the value of the currently selected text but not if selection is
      more than 1000 characters.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
       Some features use file name patterns to see which variable to use. For example, the lexer
      variable can be specialised for a particular file, or a group of files based upon wildcard
      matching so:<br />
       <b>lexer.makefile=makefile</b> indicates that the lexer called "makefile" should be used on
      files called "makefile".<br />
       <b>lexer.*.cxx=cpp</b> indicates that the lexer called "cpp" should be used on files with a
      "cxx" extension.<br />
       Variable substitution is available on the left hand side of file pattern assignments and
      look like this:<br />
       <b>file.patterns.html=*.html;*.htm;*.asp;*.shtml</b><br />
       <b>command.go.$(file.patterns.html)=file://$(FilePath)</b>
    </p>

      <tr>
        <td>
          tabsize
        </td>
        <td>
          Sets the size of a tab as a multiple of the size of a space character in the style of the
          default style definition.
        </td>
      </tr>

           position.height
        </td>
        <td>
          Set the initial window size and position. If these are ommitted or set to 0 then the
          environments defaults are used. Currently, the GTK+ version uses hard coded sizes rather
          than these.

          are.you.sure<br />
           are.you.sure.for.build
        </td>
        <td>
          The classic GUI question. Normally, when SciTE is about to close a file which has unsaved
          edits it asks this annoying question. To turn off the question, set are.you.sure to 0 and
          files will be automatically saved without bothering the user. To abandon edits to a file
          use the New command. New always asks "Are you sure?" giving an opportunity to not save
          the file.<br />
           When running or building a file, its most likely that you want the file to be saved
          first. To enable a confirmation dialog for performing commands in the Tools menu, set
          are.you.sure.for.build=1.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          view.eol
        </td>
        <td>
          Setting this to 1 makes SciTE display the characters that make up line ends. This looks
          similar to (CR), (LF), or (CR)(LF). This is useful when using files created on another
          operating system with software that is picky about line ends.

        <td>
          There is a blank margin on both sides of the text. It is drawn in the background colour
          of default text. This defaults to one pixel for both left and right sides but may be
          altered with these settings.

          Setting this to a number makes SciTE display a selection margin to the left of the text.
          The value is the number of pixels wide the selection margin should be. Line markers are
          displayed in the selection margin area.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          line.numbers

        <td>
          Setting this to a number makes SciTE start up with a column of line numbers displayed to
          the left of the selection margin. The value is the number of pixels wide the line numbers
          can be.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          use.palette
        </td>
        <td>
          Setting this to 1 makes SciTE use a palette to enable it to display more colours on 8 bit
          displays. Without this option SciTE will only display with colours already available
          which is normally the 20 colour Windows system palette. The downside of turning on this
          option is that there will be some flashing as windows are activated. This option has no
          effect on GTK+ where a palette is always used.

          buffered.draw
        </td>
        <td>
          Setting this to 0 rather than the default 1 makes SciTE draw output directly to the
          screen rather than into a buffer bitmap first and then to the screen. Buffered drawing
          flickers less but is slower.

          load.on.activate<br />
           save.on.deactivate
        </td>
        <td>
          The load.on.activate property causes SciTE to check whether the current file has been
          updated by another process whenever it is activated. This is useful when another editor
          such as a WYSIWYG HTML editor, is being used in conjunction with SciTE.<br />
           The save.on.deactivate property causes SciTE to save the file whenever the SciTE
          application loses focus. This is useful when developing web pages and you want to often
          check the appearance of the page in a browser.

          Sets the colours used for displaying selected text. If one of these is not set then that
          attribute is not changed for the selection. The default is to show the selection by

          Sets the rate at which the caret blinks. The value is the time in milliseconds that the
          caret is visible before it is switched to invisible. It then stays invisible for the same
          period before appearing again. A value of 0 stops the caret from blinking.

        <td>
          Indicates long lines. The default edge.mode, 0, does not indicate long lines. An
          edge.mode of 1 uses a vertical line to indicate the specified column and an edge.mode of
          2 changes the background colour of characters beyond that column. For proportional fonts,
          an edge.mode of 2 is more useful than 1.

          api.<i>filepattern</i>
        </td>
        <td>
          Loads an API file for a particular language. API files contain a sorted list of
          identifiers and function prototypes, one per line. The "Complete Identifier" command
          looks at the characters before the caret and displayed the subset of the api file
          starting with that string. When an opening brace is typed, the file is searched for the
          text preceding the caret and if a function prototype is found then it is displayed as a
          calltip. The .api files can be generated by hand or by using <a
          href="http://fly.hiwaay.net/~darren/ctags">ctags</a> and then the <a href="tags2api.py">
          tags2api Python script</a> (which assumes C/C++ source) on the tags file to grab complete
          multiple line function prototypes. For example, the setting <br /><br />
	 <code>
		api.*.c=w.api<br />
	 </code><br />
	          could be used with a w.api file containing <br /><br />
	 <code>
		fclose(FILE* fileClose)<br />
		FILE<br />
		fopen(const char* szFileName, const char* szMode)<br />
		fpos_t<br />
		fread(void* buf, size_t size, size_t count, FILE* file)<br />
		fseek(FILE* file, long lnOffset, int nOrigin)<br />
	 </code><br />
          to provide autocompletion and calltips for some of the C file functions. It is best to
          use the full path to the API file as otherwise the current directory is used.<br />

          This is a complex expresion used for determining the file types that will be available in

          character, some file patterns, and another '|' character. In the distributed
          SciTEGlobal.properties file, the line continuation character '\', is used to spread these
          items out, one per line. These file types appear in the "Files of type:" pull down. The
          first item is the default, so you may wish to change the first item to include the file
          types you commonly open. This option has no effect on GTK+ where a filter of * is always
          in effect.

          Shift+F4 keys can be used to move through all the matches. The $(find.what) and

          A lexer splits a file up into syntactic pieces. SciTE can then display these pieces in
          different visual styles. Several lexers are available in SciTE for some of the popular
          programming languages such as Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript and VB. Often several file
          extensions (.cpp, .cc, .h) can map to one language (C++) and hence one lexer. These
          settings associate a file name with a lexer.

        <td>
          Most of the lexers differentiate between names and keywords and use the keywords
          variables to do so. To avoid repeating the keyword list for each file extension, where
          several file extensions are sed for one language, a keywordclass variable is defined in
          the distributed properties file although this is just a convention. Some lexers define a
          second set of keywords which will be displayed in a diferrent style to the first set of
          keywords. This is used in the HTML lexer to display JavaScript keywords in a different
          style to HTML tags and attributes.

          The lexers determine a style number for each lexical type, such as keyword, comment or

          each lexer.<br />
           The value of each setting is a set of ',' separated fields, some of which have a
          subvalue after a ':'. The fields are font, size, fore, back, italics, notitalics, bold,
          notbold, eolfilled, and noteolfilled. The font field has a subvalue which is the name of
          the font, the fore and back have colour subvalues, the size field has a numeric size
          subvalue, and the bold, italics and eolfilled fields have no subvalue. The value

          Brace highlighting is a feature that shows the range of a brace when the caret is
          positioned immediately after it. It is especially useful when complex nested braces are
          used. The characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}' are considered braces. The feature
          defaults to off (because it slows cursor movement) unless braces.check is set to 1. If
          braces.sloppy is set to 1 then if there is no brace before the caret then the character
          after the caret is checked. The highlighting is performed by displaying the braces in
          style number 34 or in style number 35 if there is no matching brace. While this is a full
          style, to avoid partial display of the braces, it is best to make this style differ from
          the standard style of braces only in foreground and background colour. Only braces with
          style set to braces.<i>lexer</i>.style (which defaults to 0) are candidates for brace
          match highlighting.

          Sometimes a file must be compiled or built before it can be run. If this is the case,

	 <code>
		command.name.0.*.cc=Indent<br />
		command.0.*.cc=astyle -taO $(FileNameExt)<br />
		command.is.filter.0.*.cc=1<br />
	 </code><br />
          The first line defines the string that will appear in the tools menu (immediately below
          'Go'. The second line is the command string, similar to those of the compile, build, and
          go commands. The optional command.is.filter property states that the command modifies the
          current file so it may need to be read in after performing the command if
          load.on.activate is set.<br />
           The subsystem determines how the command is executed on Windows. 0, the default is for
          command line programs and 1 for programs which create their own windows.

       Supporting a new language
    </h3>
    <p>
       For languages very similar to existing supported languages, which may only differ in a minor
      feature such as the keywords used, the existing lexers can often be reused. The set of
      keywords can then be changed to suit the new language. Java and JavaScript could have
      reasonably reused the C++ lexer. The Java lexer was added only to support doc comments.
    </p>
    <p>
       For languages that can not be lexed with the existing lexers, a new lexer can be coded in
      C++.
    </p>
    <p>
       The open.filter should be modified to include the file extensions used for the new language
      and entries added for command.compile, command.build, command.go and command.go.needs for the
      language.
