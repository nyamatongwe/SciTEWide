    <h3>
       Standard Editing
    </h3>
    <p>
       Text editing in SciTE works similarly to most Macintosh or Windows editors with the added
      feature of automatic syntax styling. SciTE will only edit one file at a time, but does list
      recently opened files on the File menu making it easier to open recent files. Rectangular
      regions of text can be selected in SciTE by holding down the Alt key on Windows or the Ctrl
      key on GTK+ while dragging the mouse over the text.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are two panes in SciTE, the editing pane and the output pane. The output pane is
      located either to the right of the editing pane or below it. Initially it is of zero size, but
      it can be made larger by dragging the divider between it and the editing pane. The Edit |
      Vertical Split command can be used to move the output pane beneath the editing pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       SciTE can perform commands to compile or run source files with the output from these
      commands directed into the output pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, if <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is installed on the machine, open
      a new document, type:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<kbd>
print "Hi"
</kbd>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       as that document's text.
    </p>
    Save the document as printhi.py. <br />
     The document should now appear coloured as SciTE is using the file's extension to decide upon
    the syntax styling to use: 
    <blockquote>
	<code>
		<b><font color="#000080">print </font></b>
		<i><font color="#800080">"hi"</font></i>
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    Perform the Tools | Go command.<br />
     The output window will be made visible if it is not already visible and will show:<br />
    <blockquote>
	<code>
		<font color="#0000FF">&gt;python -u printhi.py</font><br />
		hi<br />
		<font color="#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 0</font>
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    The first blue line is from SciTE showing the command it will use to run the program. The black
    line is the output from running the Python program. The last blue line is from SciTE showing
    that the program has finished and displaying its exit code. An exit code of zero indicates a
    successful run. <br />
     
    <p>
       SciTE partially understands the error messages produced by Python, GCC, Visual C++, Borland
      C++ and other tools which use the same format as one of these. To see this, add a mistake to
      the Python file by adding a second line to make the file:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
	<code>
	<span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold;">print </span>
	<span style="color:#800080;font-style:italic;">"hi"</span><br />
	mistake
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       Perform the Tools | Go command. The results should look like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;python -u printhi.py</span>
hi
Traceback (innermost last):
  <span style="color:#FF0000">File "printhi.py", line 2, in ?</span>
    mistake
NameError: mistake
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 1</span>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       While it is easy to see where the problem is in this simple case, when a file is larger the
      Tools | Next Message command can be used to view each of the reported errors. Upon performing
      Tools | Next Message, the first error message in the output pane is highlighted with a yellow
      background, and an error indicator is displayed for the appropriate line in the editing pane.
      The caret is moved to this line and the pane is scrolled if needed to show the line. SciTE
      now looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="PrintHi.png" alt="SciTE after running Python interpreter" /> 
    <p>
       SciTE understands both the file name and line number parts of error messages in most cases
      so can open another file (such as a header file) if errors were caused by that file. This
      feature may not work where the file name is complicated by containing spaces or ".."
    </p>
    <p>
       If command execution has failed and is taking too long to complete then the Tools | Stop
      Executing command can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
       On Windows, SciTE defaults to executing tools as command line programs. Executing a GUI
      program in this mode results in that program being run without displaying a window. The
      command.subsystem option can be used to define tools that run in GUI mode. The default
      subsystem, 0, is for command line programs, 1 is for programs which create their own windows,
      and 2 is for using the ShellExecute call. ShellExecute is a good way to open HTML files and
      similar as it handles this similarly to a user opening the file from the shell. 3 is for calling an internal 
      extension and 4 is for calling the Windows specific HtmlHelp program.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Command line arguments
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE will open the filename given as a command line argument. If double quotes 
       surround the file name, they are stripped before opening. On Windows, the "/p" 
       argument opens a file, prints it and then immediately exits.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Buffers
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE may be configured to use between 1 and 10 buffers each containing a 
       file. The default is 1 and this effectively turns off buffers. With more than one buffer,
       the Buffers menu can be used to switch between buffers, either by selecting the 
       file name or using the Previous (F6) and Next (Shift+F6) commands. 
     </p>
     <p>
       When all the buffers contain files, then opening a new file causes a buffer to be reused
       which may require a file to be saved. In this case an alert is displayed to ensure the user 
       wants the file saved.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Languages understood by SciTE
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE currently is able to syntax style these languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Python
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++
      </li>
      <li>
        IDL - both MSIDL and XPIDL
      </li>
      <li>
        Java
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML with embedded JavaScript, VBScript, PHP and ASP
      </li>
      <li>
        XML
      </li>
      <li>
        INI, properties and similar
      </li>
      <li>
        VB and VBScript
      </li>
      <li>
        A subset of Perl
      </li>
      <li>
        SQL
      </li>
      <li>
        Lua
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Running and building commands for some of these languages have been set up but should be
      checked as they will have to be modified to work for many people.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Keyboard commands
    </h3>
    <p>
       Keyboard commands in SciTE mostly follow common Windows and GTK+ conventions. Keyboard
      equivalents of menu commands are listed in the menus. Some less common commands with no menu
      equivalent are:

    <h3>
       Folding
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE supports folding for Python and C++/C/Java/Javascript. 
       Fold points are based upon indentation for Python and on counting braces 
       for the other languages. The fold point markers can be clicked to 
       expand and contract folds. Ctrl+Shift+Click in the fold margin
       will expand or contract all the top level folds. Ctrl+Click on a fold
       point to toggle it and perform the same operation on all children.
       Shift+Click on a fold point to show all children.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Properties file
    </h3>
    <p>
       Much of SciTE's behaviour can be changed by editing the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are three properties files used, a global properties file called "SciTEGlobal.properties", 
      a per user file called "SciTEUser.properties" 
      (with a dot for the GTK+ version: ".SciTEUser.properties") 
      and a local one called 
      "SciTE.properties" which may be present in the same directory as the file being edited. 
      On Windows, both the global and user properties files are in the directory of the executable.
      For GTK+ the user properties file is found in the user's home directory and the global
      properties in a directory set at build time - normally /usr/share/scite. 
      If the "SciTE_HOME" environment variable is set on either Windows or GTK+ then it is where
      both the global and user properties files are found.
      Settings in the local properties file override those in the user properties file which override those
      in the global properties files. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The user properties file is intended for customisation by the user, 
      leaving the global properties file to contain the default options distributed with SciTE.
      The main use of the local properties files is to change the effects of the
      Compile, Build and Go commands for the files in a directory. For example, I use the javac
      compiler from the Java Development Kit for most work, so SciTEGlobal.properties sets the
      command for compiling .java files to "javac". If I want to use the jvc compiler for the files
      in one directory, then the SciTE.properties file in that directory contains an entry setting
      the command to "jvc".
    </p>
    <p>
       There are commands in the Options menu for opening each of the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       The files are in approximately the same format as Java properties files which have a simple
      text format. Lines that start with '#' or that are completely blank are comments. Other lines
      are of the form
    </p>
    <p>
       variable=value
    </p>
    <p>
       For long values, a '\' character at the end of the line continues that value on the next
      line. Values may include the values of other variables by using $(variablename). There are
      some variables set by the environment to access the name of the current file as well:
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>FilePath</b> is the full path of the current file.<br />
       <b>FileDir</b> is the directory of the current file without a trailing slash.<br />
       <b>FileName</b> is the base name of the current file.<br />
       <b>FileExt</b> is the extension of the current file.<br />
       <b>FileNameExt</b> is $(FileName).$(FileExt).<br />
       <b>CurrentSelection</b> is the value of the currently selected text but not if selection is
      more than 1000 characters.<br />
       <b>CurrentWord</b> is the value of word which the caret is within or near.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
       Some features use file name patterns to see which variable to use. For example, the lexer
      variable can be specialised for a particular file, or a group of files based upon wildcard
      matching so:<br />
       <b>lexer.makefile=makefile</b> indicates that the lexer called "makefile" should be used on
      files called "makefile".<br />
       <b>lexer.*.cxx=cpp</b> indicates that the lexer called "cpp" should be used on files with a
      "cxx" extension.<br />
       Variable substitution is available on the left hand side of file pattern assignments and
      look like this:<br />
       <b>file.patterns.html=*.html;*.htm;*.asp;*.shtml</b><br />
       <b>command.go.$(file.patterns.html)=file://$(FilePath)</b>
    </p>
    <h3>
       Importing properties files and conditional logic
    </h3>
    <p>
       The 'import' statement includes a properties file as if the text were
       inline at that point. The imported properties file
       must be in the same directory as the current file and a .properties
       extension is assumed. Therefore a "import Lua" statement in 
       c:\os\scite\bin\SciTEGlobal.properties will import 
       c:\os\scite\bin\Lua.properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'if' statement takes one argument which is a
      symbol that may be defined earlier in this property set file or in a base
      property set. If the symbol evaluates to '0' then the test fails. An empty
      string or not present symbol evaluates to 0. Into the very top property set
      is inserted one of 'PLAT_GTK' with value '1' or 'PLAT_WIN' with value '1'.
      If the test succeeds then following indented statements are executed. When a
      non-indented statement is found the if clause is finished. Only simple set
      statements are allowed in if clauses. The evaluation of if statements occurs
      at read time, not at evaluation time.
    </p>

	Values outside this range are clamped to be within the range.
	The default is 1 which turns off UI features concerned with buffers.<br />
	This value is read only once, early in the startup process and only from the
	global properties files. So after changing it, restart SciTE to see the effect.

        <td>
          The classic GUI question. Normally, when SciTE is about to close a file which has unsaved
          edits it asks this annoying question. To turn off the question, set are.you.sure to 0 and
          files will be automatically saved without bothering the user. To abandon edits to a file
          use the New command. New always asks "Are you sure?" giving an opportunity to not save
          the file.<br />
           When running or building a file, its most likely that you want the file to be saved
          first. To enable a confirmation dialog for performing commands in the Tools menu, set
          are.you.sure.for.build=1.

	On Windows, setting code.page to 65001 starts Unicode mode and the document is treated as 
	a sequence of characters expressed as UTF-8. Display is performed by converting to UCS-2
	first so characters from any language will be displayed. Correct glyphs will only be displayed

          A lexer splits a file up into syntactic pieces. SciTE can then display these pieces in

          extensions (.cpp, .cc, .h) can map to one language (C++) and hence one lexer. These

          several file extensions are sed for one language, a keywordclass variable is defined in
          the distributed properties file although this is just a convention. Some lexers define a
          second set of keywords which will be displayed in a different style to the first set of
          keywords. This is used in the HTML lexer to display JavaScript keywords in a different
          style to HTML tags and attributes.

           The value of each setting is a set of ',' separated fields, some of which have a

          Brace highlighting is a feature that shows the range of a brace when the caret is
          positioned immediately after it. It is especially useful when complex nested braces are
          used. The characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}' are considered braces. The feature
          defaults to off (because it slows cursor movement) unless braces.check is set to 1. If
          braces.sloppy is set to 1 then if there is no brace before the caret then the character
          after the caret is checked. The highlighting is performed by displaying the braces in
          style number 34 or in style number 35 if there is no matching brace. While this is a full
          style, to avoid partial display of the braces, it is best to make this style differ from
          the standard style of braces only in foreground and background colour. Only braces with
          style set to braces.<i>lexer</i>.style (which defaults to 0) are candidates for brace
          match highlighting.

          These settings choose which commands to execute when the Compile, Build or Go menu items

          Sometimes a file must be compiled or built before it can be run. If this is the case,
          this setting indicates what command needs to be run to perform the compile or build step
          before running the file. When a file is compiled, this is noted and future runs will not
          perform a compile or build. To make a 'compile and go' Go command for .c files:<br /><br />
	 <code>
		command.go.*.c=$(FileName)<br />
		command.go.needs.*.c=g++ $(FileNameExt) -o $(FileName)<br />

          Extra commands can be added to the tools menu. For example to include the 'astyle'

          The first line defines the string that will appear in the tools menu (immediately below
          'Go'. The second line is the command string, similar to those of the compile, build, and
          go commands. The optional command.is.filter property states that the command modifies the
          current file so it may need to be read in after performing the command if
          load.on.activate is set.<br />
           The subsystem determines how the command is executed on Windows. 0, the default is for
          command line programs, 1 for programs which create their own windows, 2 for running
	by using ShellExecute, 3 for running in an internal extension, and 4 for running HtmlHelp 
	on Windows. When using subsystem 4, the command has two parts separeted by ! with the first 
	part being the topic to search for and the second the name of the help file.

	  using as many tabs as possible.

          Determines the look of automatic indentation. Automatic indentation is turned on with

	 <code>
		if (c)<br />
		{<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s;<br />
		}<br />

	  Each of these settings starts with a style number and then a set of words or characters 
	  that define how to recognise that feature. It there is second space in the setting then 
	  it is a set of words, otherwise a set of characters. The set of keywords used to indicate
	  the start of a compound statement is defined in statement.indent. For example:<br /><br />
	 <code>
		statement.indent.$(file.patterns.cpp)=5 if else while
	 </code><br /><br />
          says that for C++ the words "if", "else", and "while" in keyword style, 5, start compound 
	  statements which leads to the next line being indented if no other factors affect it. However,
	  if a statement end is found on the same line then the next line is not indented. For C++ the 
	  statement end is the semicolon in the operator style, so this is defined:<br /><br />
	 <code>
		statement.end.$(file.patterns.cpp)=10 ;
	 </code><br /><br />
	 The number of lines looked at to determine indentation can be set with statement.lookback.
	 This can be used either to bound the amount of time spent on this task or to specify 
	 that only the last line be examined for indentation.<br />
	 The block.start and block.end properties define the language elements used to bracket groups
	 of statements. In C++ these are '{' and '}'.

       Supporting a new language
    </h3>
    <p>
       For languages very similar to existing supported languages, which may only differ in a minor
      feature such as the keywords used, the existing lexers can often be reused. The set of
      keywords can then be changed to suit the new language. Java and JavaScript could have
      reasonably reused the C++ lexer. The Java lexer was added only to support doc comments.
    </p>
    <p>
       For languages that can not be lexed with the existing lexers, a new lexer can be coded in
      C++.

       The open.filter should be modified to include the file extensions used for the new language
      and entries added for command.compile, command.build, command.go and command.go.needs for the
      language.
